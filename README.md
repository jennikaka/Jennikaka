### 👋 Hi, I’m Jenny Hui

I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo currently working on enterprise AI inference platform systems at Cerebras Systems. I’m interested in backend, infrastructure, and platform engineering roles focused on reliability, scale, and correctness.

Previously, I’ve built and shipped production systems across full-stack, data, and embedded environments, including work at Rundoo, Scotiabank, Ford, and DataPower.

### 🔧 What I work on

- AI inference platforms: usage accounting, quotas, billing trust, reliability

- Backend systems: Go, Python, Java, distributed workflows, APIs

- Data & infra: pipelines, validation, correctness, production monitoring

- Product-facing systems with real users and operational constraints

### 🚀 Selected Projects
#### LinearViz: Interactive 3D Linear Algebra Platform

🏆 Winner, Google × University of Waterloo Futures Lab
An interactive 3D platform that turns abstract linear algebra concepts into manipulable geometry, helping students build intuition for AI and data-driven fields.

#### Squiro: Collaborative Travel Organization App

A mobile app that centralizes travel logistics (flights, hotels, reservations) while adding a shared memory layer with collaborative albums, stats, and recap reels.
Built with Firebase and a product-first, social design focus. 🔗 [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIvlKHlkFc4)

#### Job Application Autopilot: Hack the North 2025

An end-to-end agent that scrapes job postings, matches them to user profiles, and auto-generates tailored resumes and cover letters.
Uses Playwright automation, vector search (FAISS), and LLM-driven document generation under strict schemas.
